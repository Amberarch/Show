# SGround
A real shader background for your Linux Desktop

## Why should I use this?
There is no reason to use this. It is waist of resources,
but it is nice to look at. To save resources you can
decrease the quality level.

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/danielfvm/SGround
cd SGround
make
make install
```

## Usage

sground <path> [quality]
sground <path> [quality] [speed]
```
