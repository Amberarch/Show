# SGround
A real shader background for your Linux Desktop

## Why should I use this?
There is no reason to use this. It is waist of resources,
but it looks good. To save resources you can
decrease the quality level.

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/danielfvm/SGround
cd SGround
make
make install
```

## Usage
```
sground <path>
sground <path> [quality]
sground <path> [quality] [speed]
```

quality default: 1.0
(higher: lower quality)

speed default: 1.0
(higher: faster speed)

You can write your own fragment shader, or get one
from: http://glslsandbox.com/

## Future Work
* Mouse support
* Multi Monitor support
* Support for tiling window managers
